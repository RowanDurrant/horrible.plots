# horrible.plots
R package for making really awful plots

Have you ever wanted to make just an awful looking plot? Well this package is for you!

Supply this machine with data, axis labels and a title and it will spit out one of the worst graphs you've ever seen, 
complete with randomised colours, sizes and fonts.


It only does scatter plots right now okay don't @ me
